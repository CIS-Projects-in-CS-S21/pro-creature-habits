# Creature Habits
---
## Project overview
Creature Habits is an app that encourages users to stay on top of chores by creating a "pocket pet" that stays healthy as long as chores are being done each day. Each day notifications will show up on the personâ€™s phone to remind them about tasks and chores that are expected to be completed for that day. By checking off that the task was completed, the overall health of the pet will increase. The goal of this app would be to help people remember to do chores by giving them a reason to accomplish set tasks each day, which would be taking care of their pet.
