# NPM Versioning Log

### Version 3.0.0
	- Add min and max date
	- Update calendar on props change
	Details
		- Add min and max date
			Disables the day if it's less than minDate or greater than maxDate.
			Also disables next and previous links when appropriate.
		- Update calendar on props change
			This is necessary when you're changing the selectedDate prop of CalendarPicker programmatically.
			For example, in our app after a user selects a date and clicks submit, we reset the form and set the CalendarPicker selectedDate to new Date(). However, the CalendarPicker calendar doesn't actually update.
