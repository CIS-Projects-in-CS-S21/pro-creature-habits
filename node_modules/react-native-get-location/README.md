âš› Simple to use React Native library to get native device location for Android and iOS.

## Requirements

- React Native >= 0.45.0
- iOS >= 8.0

## Install

Install dependency package
```bash
yarn add react-native-get-location
```
Or
```bash
npm i -S react-native-get-location
```

If you are using `React Native 0.60.+` go to the folder **your-project/ios** and run `pod install`, and you're done. 

If not, use one of the following method to link.

## Link with `react-native link`

If you are using `React Native <= 0.59.X`, link the native project:

```bash
react-native link react-native-get-location
```

## Android post install

For Android API < 23 you need to define the location permissions on `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<!-- Define ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION if you will use enableHighAccuracy=true  -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>

<!-- Define ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION if you will use enableHighAccuracy=false  -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
```

## iOS post install

You need to define the permission [NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW26) on `Info.plist`.

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs to get your location...</string>
```

## Usage

There is only one function that you need to use to get the user's current location.

```js
import GetLocation from 'react-native-get-location'

GetLocation.getCurrentPosition({
    enableHighAccuracy: true,
    timeout: 15000,
})
.then(location => {
    console.log(location);
})
.catch(error => {
    const { code, message } = error;
    console.warn(code, message);
})
```

For more details, see the [Sample Project](https://github.com/douglasjunior/react-native-get-location/blob/master/Sample/App.js).

## API

### function `GetLocation.getCurrentPosition(LocationConfig)`

**Parameters:**
   - [`LocationConfig`](#object-locationconfig): Configuration object to determine how to get the user current location.

**Return:**
   - `Promise<`[`Location`](#object-location)`>`: Promise thats resolve to a Location object.

### Object `LocationConfig`

**Properties:**
   - `enableHighAccuracy`: Set `true` to use 'fine location' (GPS) our `false` to use 'course location' (Wifi, Bluetooth, 3G).
   - `timeout`: The max time (in milliseconds) that you want to wait to receive a location.

### Object `Location`

**Properties:**
   - `latitude`: The latitude, in degrees.
   - `longitude`: The longitude, in degrees.
   - `altitude`: The altitude if available, in meters above the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid.
   - `accuracy`: The estimated horizontal accuracy of this location, radial, in meters.
   - `speed`: The speed if it is available, in meters/second over ground.
   - `time`: The UTC time of this fix, in milliseconds since January 1, 1970.
   - `bearing`: *(Android only)* The bearing, in degrees.
   - `provider`: *(Android only)* The name of the provider that generated this fix.
   - `verticalAccuracy`: *(iOS only)* The vertical accuracy of the location. Negative if the altitude is invalid.
   - `course`: *(iOS only)* The course of the location in degrees true North. Negative if course is invalid. (0.0 - 359.9 degrees, 0 being true North)

### Error codes

|Code|Message|
|-|-|
|`CANCELLED`|Location cancelled by user or by another request|
|`UNAVAILABLE`|Location service is disabled or unavailable|
|`TIMEOUT`|Location request timed out|
|`UNAUTHORIZED`|Authorization denied|
